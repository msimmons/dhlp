+ Define drivers with their jar files in dhlp.xml and add the driver jar files to jedit classpath
+ Autocommit and fetch limit per connection (default global)
+ Close connections and tabs consistently
+ Connection pool managed by connection frame; taken and given back by JDBCTableModel
+ blocking when changing tabs -- solved by separate connections per sql panel
+ display byte[] results as hex string
+ Open cursors (make sure to close statements and result sets) -- maybe fixed
+ EXPLAIN PLAN (for oracle)
